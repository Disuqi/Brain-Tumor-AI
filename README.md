# Brain Tumor Detector AI
This is a deep learning, neural network I developed for my Final Year Bachelor Thesis. Different datasets were combined and used with the TensorFlow and Keras libraries to train the model. The model is able to detect brain tumors in MRI images with an accuracy of 98%. Different datasets were utlized and combined to achieve this accuracy.

FYI: The code is extremely messy and unformatted, as it was developed in a short period of time and was not intended to be used or inspected by anyone else.
